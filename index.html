    <hr>
    <p>This task is an assignment that requires the demonstration of knowledge about HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). <br> It involves understanding the fundamental structure of an HTML document, which includes using <b> tags and elements, formatting text, and creating links and anchors.</b> </p>

    <p>The assignment requires creating an <em>HTML file </em> that showcases these concepts and <u>submitting it on GitHub</u>, a web-based platform for version control and collaboration.
