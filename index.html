    <p>This task is an assignment that requires the demonstration of knowledge about HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It involves understanding the fundamental structure of an HTML document, which includes using <b> tags and elements, formatting text, and creating links and anchors.</b> </p>

    <p>The assignment requires creating an HTML file that showcases these concepts and <u>submitting it on GitHub</u>, a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. HTML tags are codes used to define elements within an HTML document, while elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <i>Text formatting in HTML involves using tags to change the presentation of text, such as making it bold or italicized.</i></p>

    <p>Creating links and anchors involves using the <a> tag to hyperlink text to another webpage or a specific location within the same webpage.</p>

        <h2>Anchor</h2>
        An anchor element is a type of HTML tag that is used to create a hyperlink. It usually consists of the <a> tag and the href attribute which specifies the URL that the link will take the user to when clicked.
        <br>To add a navigation link, first create a new section within the document and give it a heading that accurately describes the content within that section. Then, create an anchor element and set the href attribute to the ID of the section that was just created. This will allow the user to click on the navigation link and be taken directly to that specific section within the document.
